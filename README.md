# Capstone-I---Allergen_Recipes

Utilizing Spoonacular API, create a simple web application allowing a User to search for recipes excluding ingredients related to major food allergies.


Made with Python, Flask, SQLalchemy, PSQL, and Javascript:

- Users may sign up with a email username and password.

- They may log in with these credentials.

- Once logged in, users can save and unsave any recipes they find upon their search.

- Users can refer back to a list of their saved recipes at any time. 

- Users can also delete a saved recipe from their list at any time.



All tests were written with Python Unittest.
